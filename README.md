## Project Title
Campus Bridge â€“ Integrated Academic LMS + Coding Skill Development Platform

## Selected Domain
Web Development

## Problem Statement / Use Case
Build a unified web application that functions as an end-to-end academic and coding skill development environment for university students. The platform should integrate:
- LMS capabilities to manage academic courses, attendance, assessments, and faculty interaction (ex: My Camu)
- Coding training modules with an online compiler, structured learning paths, problem-solving tracks, and performance analytics just like Talentio.

## Abstract / Problem Description
University students often struggle with fragmented learning experiences, using separate platforms for academic coursework and coding skill development. This disconnection creates inefficiencies, inconsistent user experiences, and missed opportunities for integrated learning analytics. SkillSync Campus addresses this challenge by creating a unified platform that seamlessly combines traditional Learning Management System (LMS) functionality with specialized coding education tools.

The platform enables students to access academic course materials, submit assignments, track attendance, and interact with faculty while simultaneously developing coding skills through structured learning paths, interactive coding challenges, and real-time compiler feedback. Faculty can monitor student progress across both academic and coding domains, providing targeted interventions based on comprehensive performance analytics. This integrated approach enhances the educational experience, streamlines administrative processes, and better prepares students for technical careers by directly connecting academic learning with practical coding skills.

## Tech Stack Used
This project is built with:

- Vite - Fast build tool and development server
- TypeScript - Type-safe JavaScript superset
- React - Frontend UI library
- React Router - Client-side routing
- Tailwind CSS - Utility-first CSS framework
- MongoDB - NoSQL database for flexible data storage
- React Query - Data fetching and state management


## Project Explanation
SkillSync Campus is designed as a comprehensive educational platform with two main integrated components:

1. **Academic LMS Module**:
   - Course management with syllabus, materials, and resources
   - Attendance tracking and reporting
   - Assignment submission and grading
   - Faculty-student communication channels
   - Academic performance analytics

2. **Coding Skill Development Module**:
   - Interactive coding environment with online compiler
   - Structured learning paths for different programming languages
   - Problem-solving tracks with increasing difficulty levels
   - Real-time code validation and feedback
   - Coding performance analytics and progress tracking

The platform features a unified dashboard that provides students with a holistic view of their academic and coding progress, while giving faculty insights into student performance across both domains. The integration of these components creates a seamless educational experience that bridges theoretical academic learning with practical coding skills development.

## Development Setup

**Use your preferred IDE**

If you want to work locally using your own IDE, you can clone this repo and push changes.

The only requirement is having Node.js & npm installed - [install with nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#installing-and-updating)

Follow these steps:

```sh

git clone <YOUR_GIT_URL>

# Step 2: Navigate to the project directory.
cd <YOUR_PROJECT_NAME>

# Step 3: Install the necessary dependencies.
npm i

# Step 4: Start the development server with auto-reloading and an instant preview.
npm run dev
```

**Edit a file directly in GitHub**

- Navigate to the desired file(s).
- Click the "Edit" button (pencil icon) at the top right of the file view.
- Make your changes and commit the changes.

**Use GitHub Codespaces**

- Navigate to the main page of your repository.
- Click on the "Code" button (green button) near the top right.
- Select the "Codespaces" tab.
- Click on "New codespace" to launch a new Codespace environment.
- Edit files directly within the Codespace and commit and push your changes once you're done.
